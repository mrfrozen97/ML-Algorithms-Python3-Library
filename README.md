# ML-Algorithms-Python3-Library

This is a library that does all the heavy lifting for the basic ml algorithms such as regression, knn, svm, etc. But, currently this has only linear regression, logisti regression, Naive bayes, knn and some data visualisation algorithms along with their visulisation. But in fututre I would extend this projects to ......... The speciality about this library is you can plot the outcomes on graph in a single line using class included in the library. Which is fed with default parameters. Which you can change according to your requirements.It uses the following libraries 1) Numpy 2) Matplotlib
